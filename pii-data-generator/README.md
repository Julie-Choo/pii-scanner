# PII Test Data Generator

## What This App Does

This desktop application creates **realistic fake employee data** that looks like it came from a real company database. It generates a spreadsheet with 100,000 rows and 50 columns of information including names, addresses, social security numbers, medical codes, and work details.

**Perfect for testing tools that find sensitive information in databases.**

## How the Data Generation Works

üé≤ **Creates Random New Data Every Time**
- Each time you click "Generate," you get completely different data
- John Smith in run #1 becomes Sarah Garcia in run #2
- All names, addresses, phone numbers, and IDs are randomly created

üìù **Uses Built-In Lists (No Internet Required)**
- The app has pre-built lists of common names, cities, medical codes, etc.
- It randomly picks from these lists and combines them differently each time
- **Does NOT connect to the internet or pull data from public websites**
- **Works completely offline** - no privacy concerns

üè¢ **Realistic Like Real Company Data**
- Some employees have complete information, others are missing details
- Includes work info (departments, job titles, hire dates)
- Mixed sensitive data (SSNs, addresses) with non-sensitive data (favorite colors, hobbies)
- Real medical diagnosis codes and prescription drug names
